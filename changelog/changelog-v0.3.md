# 📜 CHANGELOG - Version 0.3: The Borea Void

> After Zone 2, it was obvious that I would move on to **Zone 3**, where I also added the **Void mobs** and a **new workbench**. This update addresses the lack of trophies for the new areas and integrates the new **Fragments** system along with several technical fixes.


## ⚙️ Features & Systems

* **Introduction of a dedicated workbench**: A new workbench is now craftable with [...]. It allows you to craft wall-mounted heads, obtain statue variants, and use the 'Fragments' trophies introduced in the last update to transform them into decorative objects/items or recycle them.

* **Crafting Displacement**: Since a new Workbench has arrived, wall-mounted head crafts are no longer craftable in the 'Furniture Workbench' but only in the 'Trophy Workbench'.

* **Rarity Balancing**: Added 'Mythic' rarity for statues. This rarity is rarer than 'Epic' but less rare than 'Legendary'.

* **Adding variants for statues**: Each statue now has at least 1 variant related to the material of where it lives (below is a list of added statues) obtainable in the new 'Trophy Workbench'.

* **Addition of 'Mythic' rarity**: The 'Mythic' rarity has been added; it is located between 'Epic' and 'Legendary' and only concerns statues.

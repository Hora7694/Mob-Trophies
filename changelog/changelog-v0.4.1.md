# 📜 CHANGELOG - Version 0.4.1: Hytale V3 Update

This update focus on compatibility with the new Hytale engine version and a complete overhaul of the Toad Rhino Magma trophies.

---

## 🚀 Compatibility & Engine

* **Hytale V3 Support**: The mod has been fully updated to be compatible with Hytale V3.
* **Internal Refactoring**: For better stability, crafting recipes are now separated from item files. Each item now has its own dedicated recipe file.

## 👁️ Visuals

* **Toad Rhino Magma**: Updated the models for the Head, Wall Head, and Statue to match the new creature design.
* **Legacy Statue**: Added a "Legacy" version of the Toad Rhino Magma statue. This allows players to keep and display the original model for nostalgia.

## 🛠️ Technical Changes

* **Architecture**: Moved all crafting logic out of the item JSONs into the new `/Recipes/` directory structure.
